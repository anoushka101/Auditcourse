	<p style="float : center;padding-right:180px; padding-left: 180px;padding-bottom: 30px; font-size: 18px; color: #FFEAC9;"> Despite being only the 28th most populous city in the United States, Portland consistently ranks in the top-5 American cities for amounts of coffee consumed, number of coffee shops, and the number of coffee and tea producers. One could look at these numbers and conclude that there is a saturated market with no room for a newcomer. We disagree.

To us, Portland's vibrant coffee market is more of an invitation than a deterrent. This city knows its coffee (as well as its beer, wine, cheese, ice cream, doughnuts... basically anything that is delicious). So we decided to join in and help provide the market what it wants... and in our little section of Portland, the market needs some serious help.
